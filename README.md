# Fallen
Slack Configuration using Natural Language Processing to find the topic of the current conversation- and rename the channel per the subject of conversation.  Plans for fallen include a fully automated conversational bot, that utilizes machine learning and Natural Language Genertion paradigms.

#Phasing

1.  Listen to conversation, parse information, create awareness of what is happening.

2.  Using wordnet coupled with manual modelling create a "knowledge base" for Fallen to refer to

3.  Create an algorithm that will combine both the knowledge base and the current conversation data into a response

4.  Add text to speech and speech to text features

5.  Using a raspberry pi/arduino put together an LED matrix and allow a talking "animation" for the bot
 
6.  Setup webserver to allow commands to be issued to embedded wifi modules throughout house.  Begin home automation
